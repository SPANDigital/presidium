time and resources to achieve your goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following steps work for both small and large projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Design the site structure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inventory existing content&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plan the conversion of existing content into articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Map the planned articles to your structure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identify required new articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repurpose existing content into articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write new articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proofread and edit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Publish&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="discussion">Discussion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important planning task is identifying the scope of your documentation efforts and understanding the needs
of your audience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design Documentation Structure</title><link>/best-practices/design-documentation-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-practices/design-documentation-structure/</guid><description>&lt;p>Before starting to write content, you should define the documentation structure to answer questions such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How many sections do I need?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What should each section cover?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do some sections need sub-sections?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Answering these and other questions will help you scope the project and define the content that needs to be found or
written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that although you should decide on the structure of your site at the beginning, you might need to make
changes as you gain a deeper understanding of the content. With Presidium, itâ€™s easy to change the structure by moving
articles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design Learning Objectives</title><link>/best-practices/define-learning-objectives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-practices/define-learning-objectives/</guid><description>&lt;p>When defining learning objectives, think carefully about what it means to use your solution effectively by doing the
following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Identify what your audience should know and be able to do after they have read the documentation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use that information to create a list of learning objectives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Just as stories are used to define software, learning objectives can be written using a standard template.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>As a [user] of the [solution] I [know a specific piece of information] or can [perform a specific task]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Often, existing stories can be converted into learning objectives with little or no alteration:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inventory Existing Content</title><link>/best-practices/inventory-existing-content/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-practices/inventory-existing-content/</guid><description>&lt;p>When starting a new documentation project, you should first review and evaluate existing content. Content from multiple
sources, such as those listed below, can be repurposed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Existing software documentation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wikis and message boards&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design documents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work tickets (epics and stories, bugs)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>API specifications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>README files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Code comments and markup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Help files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emails&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meeting notes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Project planning materials&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Before starting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Compile a list of existing content sources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identify how each item could be decomposed or converted into an article.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identify where these articles can fit in your documentation structure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="discussion">Discussion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If there is no existing documentation set, some areas will be well documented, while others will either be poorly
defined or missing. Expect to find duplicate and outdated content. Maintain a list of the best documentation you find
for any learning objective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use Article Templates</title><link>/best-practices/use-article-templates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-practices/use-article-templates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Presidium includes article templates for each of the pre-defined sections. Templates are text documents that contain instructions and Markdown which can be modified to meet your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here is the template for the Best Practices section:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>```# Template Instructions
# --------------------- 
# 1) Replace any content placeholders with the appropriate content. Search for &amp;quot;REPLACE WITH&amp;quot;.
# 2) Delete this line and all lines above so that the front matter below is at the top of the file.
---
title: REPLACE WITH Best Practice Title
author: REPLACE WITH repository username
---

REPLACE WITH a summary paragraph of the recommended practice.

```python
 REPLACE WITH A code snippet, if required, that illustrates the recommended practice. Change the name of the language if needed. DELETE the entire section if not required.
```

# Discussion

REPLACE WITH a discussion of the recommended practice. Add subheadings, code snippets and tables as required.

&lt;p>Templates encourage consistency and provide a simple checklist that an author can use for inspiration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing Effective Articles</title><link>/best-practices/write-effective-articles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-practices/write-effective-articles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Anyone can write great articles if they follow a few simple style guidelines:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make sure the title explains what the article is about. The title will be used to construct the navigation menu and will often be separated from the article body along side other article titles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure the title works on its own and describes the essence of the article.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep titles simple and succinct without using humor or colloquialisms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have one author for every article. This enable authors to quickly add documentation while also working on a product or service.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="discussion">Discussion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Articles should convey enough information to fulfill a learning objective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>General Performance Guidelines</title><link>/best-practices/general-performance-guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-practices/general-performance-guidelines/</guid><description>&lt;p>For Presidium to support the functionality it has built on top of Hugo there are some performance considerations to take into account so that build times can remain reasonable. Below are some steps that can be taken to help with overall build performance:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep total markdown content to 50MB or less, this should result in a build time of around one minute, but this cannot be guaranteed due to other factors&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
