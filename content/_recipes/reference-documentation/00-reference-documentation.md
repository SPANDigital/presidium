title: Importing Documentation
---

The reference section of Presidium should be reserved as a low-level reference for users.
Typical components documented in the reference section may include a client library or API specification.
The process of importing documentation involves parsing a reference source and generating articles that are included in the generated site.

>Where possible reference documentation should be generated to ensure that your documentation is in sync with the 
system being documented. 

Presidium will provide support for the following documentation sources:
- [javadoc comments](#javadoc)
- jsdoc comments (under development)
- swagger api (under development)

For other sources that do not yet have an importer, documentation can be [embedded](#embed) into references.
