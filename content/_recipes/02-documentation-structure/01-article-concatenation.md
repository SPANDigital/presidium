title: "Article Concatenation"
---

When a Presidium user makes a selection from the  left menu, all articles in that section are concatenated onto a single page. This allows readers to easily scroll through all articles in a section. This is a useful because adjacent articles in a section are typically related.  

This behavior is enabled by default, but can be disabled using the following `site config`:

```
include-nested-articles: true | false
```
