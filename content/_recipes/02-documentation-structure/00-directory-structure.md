title: Directory Structure
---

The structure of the site generated by Presidium follows the directory structure of the Presidium repository. Sections and articles are arranged in the operating system's default ordering of files and directories. Sections can be nested up to four levels deep although we recommend you stick to one or two levels of nesting, as too many levels makes it difficult to find content. 

The following example demonstrates how you could order and organise files and directories using numeric prefixes:

```
    .
    ├── 01-article-2.1.md
    ├── 02-article-2.2.md
    ├── 02-Directory-2.3
    │   ├── 01-article-2.3.1.md
    │   ├── 01-article-2.3.2.md
    │   ├── index.md
    ├── 03-article-2.4.md
    └── index.md
```

The names of directories and files are used for sorting, they are generally not exposed in the generated site. To aid in editing and arranging your content we recommend the file name contain the title of the article and the directory name contain the name of the section.  

The title of a sub-section should be set by providing  an `index.md` file in the folder with the following `front matter`:

```
---
title: Sub Section Heading
---
```

If no index file is provided then the directory name is used for the section name.
