title: Directory Structure
---

The site structure generated by Presidium follows the directory structure of the Presidium repository. Sections and articles are arranged in the operating system's default ordering of files and directories. Sections can be nested up to four levels deep, although we recommend only using one or two levels of nesting to make it easier to find content.

The following is an example of how you can order and organize files and directories using numeric prefixes:

```
    .
    ├── 01-article-2.1.md
    ├── 02-article-2.2.md
    ├── 02-Directory-2.3
    │   ├── 01-article-2.3.1.md
    │   ├── 01-article-2.3.2.md
    │   ├── index.md
    ├── 03-article-2.4.md
    └── index.md
```

The directory and filenames are used for sorting; they are generally not displayed in the generated site. To make it easier to edit and arrange your content, we recommend that the filename contains the title of the article and the directory name contains the name of the section.  

The title of a sub-section should be set by providing  an `index.md` file in the folder with the following `front matter`:

```
---
title: Sub Section Heading
---
```

If no index file is provided, the directory name is used as the section name.
