title: Hosting Alternatives
---

Presidium can be hosted in various different configurations. 

1. Hosted in a dedicated repo that only contains documentation 
2. Hosted in a sub-folder of an existing repo
2. Hosted in a git sub-module of an existing repo 

all approaches are valid. A stand alone repo is simpler to configure and easier to manage independently from the code. Hosting Presdium in a /docs directory inside the a code repo keeps everything in one place and makes it easier to update the docs while changing the code. A sub-module is a way to gain the best of both worlds, but comes at the price of slightly increased complexity.
