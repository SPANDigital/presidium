title: Hosting Presidium
---

Presidium can be hosted in two different configurations. 

1. Hosted in a stand alone repository that only contains documentation 
2. Hosted in a /docs folder inside another repository that usually contains the code that presdium describes

Both approaches are valid. A stand alone repo is simpler to configure and easier to manage independently from the code. Hosting Presdium in a /docs directory inside the code repo keeps everything in one place and makes it easier to update the docs while changing the code.
