title: Hosting Methods

Presidium can be hosted as:
* A dedicated repo that only contains documentation
* A sub-folder of an existing repo
* A Git sub-module of an existing repo

All configurations are valid. A dedicated repo is simpler to configure and easier to manage independently from the code. Hosting Presidium in a /docs directory inside the a code repo keeps everything in one place and makes it easier to update the documents while changing the code. A sub-module may be the best of both worlds, but is slightly more complex.
