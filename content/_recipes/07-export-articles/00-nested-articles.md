title: "Nested Articles"
---

By default, articles in sub sections are nested on a page. 
This allows users to read articles on a single page or to only view articles at a certain level.
As a reader navigates down the menu tree, only articles within a nested section are shown. 

This can be enabled or disabled using the following site config: 
 
```
include-nested-articles: true | false
```
