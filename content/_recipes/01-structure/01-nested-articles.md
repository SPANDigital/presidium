title: "Nested Articles"
---

All articles in a section are nested on a single page. 
This allows readers to scroll and read through all articles in a section on a single page.
As a reader navigates down the menu tree, only articles within nested sub-sections are shown. 

This is enabled by default, but can be disabled using the following `site config`:

```
include-nested-articles: true | false
```
