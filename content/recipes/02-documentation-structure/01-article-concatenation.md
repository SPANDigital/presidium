title: "Article Concatenation"
---

When a user of Presdium selects a section from the left menu, all articles in that section are concatenated onto a single page. This allows readers to easily scroll through all articles in a section. We believe this is a benefit because adjacent articles in a section are usually closely related and the reader often benefits for discovering these closely related articles.  

This is behavoir is enabled by default, but can be disabled using the following `site config`:

```
include-nested-articles: true | false
```
