Markdown is an ubiquitous, lighweight markup language known to almost any engineer. If you don't know Markdown, it's easy to learn. Presidium uses a version of Markdown known as [Github Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) and leverages this 'common tongue' to enable multiple contributors to create documentation quickly without wasting time doing **point & click** styling or having to alter HTML and CSS.

## Style Guides

For any documentation project, a Markdown style guide ensures that contributors write documentation that is consistent with your intended tone and layout.

## Flexibility

If you need more flexibility than Markdown offers, you can also use HTML separately or mixed with Markdown content in articles.
