You can host documentation on:

* [Github]({{site.baseurl}}/recipes/hosting/): Use a simple command line utility to publish straight to your repository's Github pages.

* [Bitbucket]({{site.baseurl}}/recipes/hosting/): Set up a separate repository to host your generated site.

* [Custom]({{site.baseurl}}/recipes/hosting/): Build Presidium documentation using a continuous integration environment. The generated website can be served by a web host of your choice depending on your particular requirements.

Presidium supports semantic versioning of your documentation when publishing to Github or Bitbucket pages. [Versioning]({{site.baseurl}}/recipes/versioning/)
