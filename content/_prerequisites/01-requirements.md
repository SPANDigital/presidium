title: "Required Software"
---

The following tools are required to build and run your site locally:
- [npm](http://www.npmjs.com) v3.10+
- [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) v2.1+
- [bundler](http://bundler.io/) v1.14.3+

Presidium uses:
 - `npm` to build, run and publish your site
 - `ruby` to run Jekyll 
 - `bunder` to manage Jekyll dependencies

All required dependencies are managed via `npm` scripts and are local to each site you create, so there is 
no need to install and configure Jekyll.
