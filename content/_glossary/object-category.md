The major role an object performs within the modeled system. There are four types of object (System, Container, Component, Class) and three categories (Functional, Data, Messaging). These can be combined in the following ways.

| Object Category         | Description 
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------
| System                  | Has a release cycle and is version numbered
| Functional Container    | A executable Service, Application, Module, or Framework
| Data Container          | A executable database instance (data at rest) 
| Message Container       | A executable message bus instance (data in flight)
| Functional Component    | An compiled library or build artifact
| Data Component          | A schema or collection of tables
| Message Component       | A message channel or topic
| Functional Class        | An object, a collection of methods and data structures
| Data Class              | A data structure, table or list flight)
| Message Class           | A message type

The Object Mame and Object Category, taken together, uniquely identify the object in it's model.
