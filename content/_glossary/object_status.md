Objects are the parts of the modeled system. There are four types of Object.

- Systems - Are the largest structures mdeled by ADSS. Systems are usually classifed into three types; External, Internal and Implementation Technologies. 
- Containers - Are the physically deployed artifacts that become running instances. They are the bridge between the logical and physical view of the modeled system.
- Components - Are the libraries, schemas and other artifacts compilied into the deployed conatiners.
- Classes - Classes are the lowest level of object tracked by DSS. They are optional and only worth tracking in certain special cases.
