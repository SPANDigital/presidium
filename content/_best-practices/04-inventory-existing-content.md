When starting a documentation initiative it is advisable to review existing content. In most cases it is possible to identify  content that can be re-purposed. Content can be obtained from a variety of sources:  

- Existing software documentation
- Wikis and message boards
- Design documents 
- Work tickets (Epics and Stories, Bugs)
- API specifications  
- README files
- Code comments and markup
- Help files
- emails
- Meeting notes
- Project planning materials 

Compile a list of existing content sources and identify how each item could be decomposed or converted into an article. Identify where these articles fit in your documentation structure. 

# Discussion 

Unless someone has already created a comprehensive set of documentation that you can start from you will typically find that some areas have been well documented while others are poorly defined or even missing altogether. Expect to find duplicate and outdated content. Keep a list of the best documentation you have found for any learning objective.
