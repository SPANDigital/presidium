When starting a documentation initiative it is advisable to review existing content. In most cases it is possible to identify  content that can be re-purposed. A content can be obtained from a variety of sources:  

- Existing software documentation
- Wikis and message boards
- Design documents 
- Work tickets (Epics and Stories, Bugs)
- API specifications  
- README files
- Code comments and markup
- Help files
- emails
- Meeting notes
- Project planning materials 

Compile a list of existing content sources and identify how each item could be decomposed or converted into an article.
