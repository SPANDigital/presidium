Over time systems evolve. Objects in the system move through a [lifecycle](/glossary/object-status/). Objects are often retired and replaced by newer, better, technologies

## Discussion 

1. Edit  object in ADSS, name it after the implementation technology you wish to track (Eg. Oracle, Redis, Apache Solr, Kafka, etc.)  Do not assign a layer to the system - this will prevent it from being drawn on the diagram.  
2. [Edit the Container](/references/screens/object-management/) whose implementation technology you want to track. The system must be contained by the container not the other way around.
