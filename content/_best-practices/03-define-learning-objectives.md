title: Define Learning Objectives

Think carefully about what it means to use your solution effectively. Try to define what your audience should know, and be able to do, once they have read your documentation. Create a list of these "learning objectives". Just like the stories used to define software, learning objectives can be written using a standard template 

> As a [user] of the [solution] I [know a specific piece of information] or can [perform a specific task]

This standard template can be used to create learning objectives like those below
    
> - As a first time user of Presidium I can easily download, install, and run the latest version.
> - As a user of Presidium I know the value of defining learning objectives for developing comprehensive content.

Clearly articulated learning objectives ensure your content stays focused on comprehensive and coherent goals. In Presidium we advise you use learning objectives to help define the title and content of articles. Each learning objective frequently corresponds to one content article.   

# Discussion 

Define the knowledge and abilities you expect your target audience to already have before starting to read your documentation. Use this to avoid wasting time explaining things you expect them to already know. 

> - As a user of Presidium I already know how to use git hub as a version control system.
> - As a user of Presdium I know what markdown is, I have used it before, and I know how to lookup details of the markdown syntax I may be unfamilar with.
