Before starting to write content it is best to define the structure of your documentation. How many sections should it have?, what should each section cover?, should some sections have sub-sections. Answering these questions helps to scope the work ahead and define the content that needs to be found or written. While you should decide on the structure of your site at the start be prepared to change it as you gain a deeper understanding of your content. With Presidium it is easy to move artciles between directories.

Presidium comes pre-configured with a standard menu structure that you can use to start scoping your documentation. You can add new sections to Presidum but we have found that the standard section are usually adequate. 

First Decide which of the pre-configured sections are not required for your content. 

| Section           | Description of Content|
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Overview          | Brief business-level overview of the solution with an explanation of the main benefits vs alternative solutions.
| Key Concepts      | Introductory description of the key concepts, components, and structures of the solution that detail each component's role and responsibilities. 
| Prequisites       | Description of the knowledge, skills, and software needed to sucessfully use the solution.
| Getting Started   | Description of how to get started using the solution
| Best Practices    | A recommended approach that should be followed when using this solution.
| Reference         | Detailed descriptions explaining the usage of each part of the solution. Usually arranged by conceptual area. This section contains the main technical content of the site. APIs, Data structures etc. 
| Recipes           | A solution for a specific problem or way to achieve achieves a specific objective. Recipes are used to show a user how to do something. 
| Glossary          | A list of definitions for terms with specific meanings in the solution documentation.
| Use Cases         | How the components of the solution work together to enable commonly implemented scenarios, with code examples.
| Tools             | A list of tools and services that can be used with this solution
| Updates           | New releases, patches or other announcements of interest to the user community.

Once you have identified the sections you want to use for your documentation, define the learning objectives for each section. Compile a comprehensive list of learning objectives.
