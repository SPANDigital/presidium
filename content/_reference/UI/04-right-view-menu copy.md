The right view menu allows you to modify the presentation of the data you have selected.

- **Depth** Controls the objects that will be displayed. For example, if a depth of 1 is selected then all objects that are directly related to the selected objects (by any [relationship type]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#relationship-type)) will also be displayed. If a depth of 2 is selected then all objects that are related to the selected objects by 2 or less relationship hops will be displayed. This powerful feature allows you to understand the dependencies for any selected objects.   
- **Zoom** provides zoom in and out capabilities 
- [Layers]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#layer) allows you to hide one or more layers from the diagram. This is often useful if you want to print a diagram and are not interested in some layers.
- **Magic** attempts to reduce the complexity of the diagram by concentrating lines and consolidating object layout. In some cases this will improve the daigram, but it depends on what you intend to use the diagram for.
