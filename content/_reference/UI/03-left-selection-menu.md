The left selection menu allows you to specify selection criteria from which  diagrams or activity reports are created. Selections are created by choosing items from one or more of the following available dimensions. 

- [Organizations]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#organization)
- [People]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#people)
- [Objects]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#object) 
- [Functional Areas]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#functional-area)
- [Layers]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#layer)

Multiple items can be chosen from each dimension. Select items are joined (logical and) together to create the selection. A summary of the current selection can be seen in the Selection Summary area.
