The top menu can take three forms depending on the context: 

- When in _Enterprise Administration_ context the top menu displays the name of the Enterprise. This mode is used when managing data that exists at the enterprise level: Organizations, People, Users, and Models.
- When in _Model Administration_ context the top menu displays the name of the Model. This mode is used when managing data that belongs to the model: Layers, Functional Areas, Objects, and Tags.
- When in _Model View_ context the top menu displays the name of the model and the date of the details that are displayed in the context area.
