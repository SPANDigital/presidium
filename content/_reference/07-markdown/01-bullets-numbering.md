title: "Bullets & Numbering"
---

Markdown allows bullets and numbering to be nested:

Use bullets when listing unordered items.

# Bullets

* Sentence 1.
* Sentence 2.
    - Nested sentence 1.
    - Nested sentence 2.
        + Double nested sentence.

```md
* Sentence 1.
* Sentence 2.
    - Nested sentence 1.
    - Nested sentence 2.
        + Double nested sentence.
```

# Numbering

Use a numbered list when describing steps in a process. You can number the list yourself, or allow Presidium to do numbering automatically:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three

4. Four
5. Five
6. Six

```md
1. One
1. Two
1. Three

4. Four
5. Five
6. Six
```
