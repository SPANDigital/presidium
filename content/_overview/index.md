ADSS is an Architecture Decision Support System, its primary purpose is to provide Developers, Technical Leads, Product Owners, and Executive Leadership with up-to-date information and historic trends for the software systems they control. ADSS automatically visualizes and quantifies many aspects of software systems that are usually obscure and difficult to assess, in doing so, it supports strategic and technical decision making at all levels in the organization.

# Models
System models are curated by engineers and product managers based on data ingested from various development and operational systems. These data are grouped together into independent models that can be queried in a variety of ways and visualized using various interactive graphical representations. ADSS models are based on a simple classification of system components. Despite this simplicity, accurate, hi-fidelity models can be created because of the flexible ways in which components can be joined together to create the model.

# Model Views
Each model can be visualized from four different perspectives. Each perspective, or View, presents the model from a different aspect, emphasizing different data and permitting different insights to be derived. The four views are called the Logical, Physical, Social, and Process views.

# Data Sources 
Models are built from data obtained from multiple sources. Data is automatically ingested, aggregated and correlated before curation overrides are applied and the data is finally loaded to the model. Data is ingested from Directory Services, Development Systems, Configuration Management Systems, Operational Monitoring Systems, System Designers and Managers
