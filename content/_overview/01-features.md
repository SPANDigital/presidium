Presidium is an open-source software documentation creation system for Agile teams and their users.

Presidium is easy to install and configure, supports flexible content authoring and publishing workflows, and includes predefined article templates to quickly get you up and running.  A team can use Presidium to:
* Develop new content
* Rapidly re-purpose existing content
* Re-use existing marked-up code (jsdoc, javadoc) and API specifications (Swagger)

Presidium provides the features you need without the bloat of many commercial solutions:

- **Automatic menus**
  - The left navigation menu is dynamically created every time you publish your site. Various options are available to control navigation behavior.

- **Versioning**
  - Support for multiple documentation versions. You can easily switch between versions without losing context.  

- **Markup Ingestion**
  - Ingestion of markedup source code and API specs allow you to reuse existing documentation investments.

- **Filtering by Role**
  - Define user roles and filter site content by a specific selected role.

- **Link Checking**
  - Make sure your links actually go somewhere!

- **Article Status Tracking**
  - Track the status of an article and manage simple authoring workflow.

- **Themes**
