From the [Object Management Screen]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/ui/#object-management-screen) select the option to add a new object.

The Object creation screen requires three fields. The object name combined with the [object category]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#object-category) uniquely identifies each object within a model. The lifecycle stage indicates the current [status]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#object-status) of the object. 

Once the object has been created it is possible to update the other object details. Some of these details affect how the object will be displayed on diagrams 

- **[Layer]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#layer)** If the layer is not defined, then the object will not be drawn on Locial view diagrams 
-  **[Lifecycle Stage]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#object-status)**
