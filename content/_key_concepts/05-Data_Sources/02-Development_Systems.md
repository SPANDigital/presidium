From source code control systems like github and SVN, continuous integration systems like Jenkins and Travis CI, artifact management systems like Artifactory, and ticket mangement systems like Jira, ADSS gathers information on: the tasks and deliverables of development teams - **Checkins** made to **Source Code** in response to **Work Tickets**, and the **Build** process that creates, **Artifacts** and **Releases** that are **Deployed** to production systems. This information is used to model the logical structure of, and dependencies between, modeled objects.
