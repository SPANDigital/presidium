The Logical view displays [Objects] from the selected model arranged by [Layer](example.com) and [Functional Area](). The Logical View is based on the C4 architectural modeling approach and shows the [Relationships]() between modeled objects. ADSS supports four types of object; [Systems](), [Containers](), [Componenets](), and [Classes](). These objects are related to each other via three types of relationship; [Calls](), [Contains]() and [Replaces]().
