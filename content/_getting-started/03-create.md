Once your site is up and running, you can start making changes to the following files and folders:

- `content/` Content folder for all your articles
- `media/` Media folder for static assets such as images, attachments or css
- `_config.yml` Site configuration properties

Updates to content, media or css can be made without having to restart the local server. 
**Structural or changes to configuration currently require a server restart.**
