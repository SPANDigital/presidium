title: Edit your Site
---
Once your basic site is up and running, you can start making changes to the following files and folders:

- `_config.yml` To configure your site metadata, sections and properties
- `content/` Content folder for all your articles
- `media/` Media folder for static assets such as images, attachments or css

Updates to content, media or css can be made without having to restart the local server. Structural or changes to configuration currently require a server restart.
