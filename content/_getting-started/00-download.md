title: Download the Template
---

Presidium includes templates for:

* Software documentation
* On-boarding
* Design systems

Download the desired template and extract the contents to a working directory. Or, just run one of the following:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-template.git
$ git clone https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-template-onboarding.git
$ git clone https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-template-design.git
```
**Note**: If you are using the [Docker](/prerequisites/local-environment-setup/#docker) instructions this step is not needed as you clone your repository as a part of the environment setup.
