title: Publish your Site
---

Presidium builds a static website in the `dist/site` directory which may be hosted by [any web server]({{site.baseurl}}/recipes/hosting/custom-hosting/).

If you are using Github or Bitbucket to manage your documentation, you may choose to use [Github Pages]({{site.baseurl}}/recipes/hosting/gh-pages/) or [Bitbucket]({{site.baseurl}}/recipes/hosting/bitbucket/) to quickly and easily publish your documentation online.
