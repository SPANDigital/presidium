title: Update Content
---

You can make changes to the following files and folders:

- `content/` Content folder for all your articles
- `media/` Media folder for static content such as images, attachments, or css
- `_config.yml` Site configuration properties

Updates to content, media, or css can be made without having to restart the local server. 

> Structural or configuration changes currently require a server restart by running: `ctr+c` and  `npm start`
