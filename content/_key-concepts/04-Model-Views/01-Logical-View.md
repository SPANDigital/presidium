The Logical view displays [Objects]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#object) from the selected model arranged by [Layer]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#layer) and [Functional Area]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#functional-area). The Logical View is based on the C4 architectural modeling approach and shows the [Relationships]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#relationship-type) between modeled objects. ADSS supports four types of [Object]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#object); Systems, Containers, Components, and Classes. These objects are related to each other via three types of [Relationship]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#relationship-type); Calls, Contains and Replaces.
