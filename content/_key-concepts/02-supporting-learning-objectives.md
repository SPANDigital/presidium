title: Presidium's Learning Model
---

Presidium is not only a framework for producing documentation. It asks you to think about, structure, author and publish content according to sensible pedagogical best practices.
In this way, you will write effective documentation and not produce documentation for documentation's sake.

# Categorizing

Often, business and technical knowledge is mostly held by a handful of people, or is spread across multiple documents with little cohesion.
 Presidium suggests a means categorizing knowledge to assist the writer in compartmentalizing and categorizing their knowledge, for improved cohesion and a logical delivery.

## Overview & Key Concepts

Almost any knowledge base requires an overview as means to ground the reader in the domain they will be learning. This supports and leads to a discussion of key concepts that **prime** the reader for a cogent use of the rest of the content. These two sections naturally are presented first, and follow one another.

## Prerequisites & Getting Started

For software projects, APIs and similar documentation, most readers will require some preparation before being able to use a product. This may include installing libraries, binaries, or reading material that they should know before proceeding.

The Prerequisites section supports Getting Started. Getting Started is intended to be a quick deep-dive, such that the user is able to get from *nowhere* to *running* in a matter of minutes.

## Best Practices

Present the best path to follow to get the most out of your product or service and reduce the potential of encountering problems. This can be a combination of anecdotal knowledge, RFCs, white papers etc.

## Reference

Store content here that enriches or supports anything from other sections: imported API documentation, deep-dives beyond the needs of most readers, etc.

## Recipes

Present a set of clear steps to explain how todo something useful or unusual with your product or service.

## Tools

## Support

## Updates

## Glossary

Bite-sized pieces of knowledge that explain a concept, resolve jargon, or lists multiple synonyms for a particluar term. Since all content here can be used for automatic tooltip generation, a useful yardstick here is whether the content can reasonably fulfill the role of a tooltip without verbosity or introducing more confusion.

# Supporting Learning Goals and Objectives

Micro-articles are good for ownership, focus, and ability to get something done quickly.
