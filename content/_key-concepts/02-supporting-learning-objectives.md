title: Presidium's Learning Model
---

Presidium is not only a framework for producing documentation. It asks you to think about, structure, author and publish content according to sensible pedagogical best practices.
In this way, you will write effective documentation and not produce documentation for documentation's sake.

# Supporting Learning Objectives & Efficiency

Presidium recommends creating small 'micro' articles that, in and of themselves, convey enough information to fulfill a learning objective. Small articles are advantageous in that they often only require a single author, force the author to focus on delivering a single concept well, and allow them to add documentation quickly whilst concurrently working on a product or service. In this way, the creation of high quality content is no longer a deferred and protracted task but one interleaved with the engineering process.

# Categorization

Often, critical business and technical knowledge is held only by a handful of people, or is spread across documents with little organization and cohesion.
 Presidium suggests a means of categorizing knowledge to assist the writer in compartmentalizing and categorizing their knowledge, for improved cohesion and a logical delivery.

## Overview & Key Concepts

Almost any knowledge base requires an overview as means to ground the reader in the correct domain. This supports and leads to a discussion of key concepts that **prime** the reader for a cogent use of the rest of the content. These two sections are naturally presented first, and follow one another.

## Prerequisites & Getting Started

For software projects, APIs and similar documentation, most readers will require some preparation before being able to use a product. This may include installing libraries, binaries, or reading material that they should know before proceeding.

The Prerequisites section supports Getting Started. Getting Started is intended to be a quick deep-dive, such that the user is able to get from *nowhere* to *running* in a matter of minutes.

## Best Practices

In this section the objective is to present the best path to follow to get the most out of your product or service and reduce the potential of encountering problems. This can be a combination of anecdotal knowledge, RFCs, white papers etc.

## Reference

Store content here that enriches or supports anything from other sections: imported API documentation, deep-dives beyond the needs of most readers, etc.

## Recipes

Present a set of clear steps to explain how todo something useful or unusual with your product or service.

## Glossary

Bite-sized pieces of knowledge that explain a concept, resolve jargon, or lists multiple synonyms for a particular term. Since all content in the Glossary can be used for automatic tooltip generation, a useful yardstick here is to ensure the content can reasonably fulfill the role of a tooltip without verbosity or introducing confusion.

## More

Tools, Uses Cases, Updates and Support are a set of other possible sections that might be of use. Presidium allows you the flexibility to define your own sections as well.
