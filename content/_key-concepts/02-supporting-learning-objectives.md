title: Presidium's Learning Model
---

Presidium is not a framework for producing documentation for documentation's sake. It instead provides suggested ways to think about, structure, author and publish content according to sensible pedagogical best practices.

# Compartmentalize

Presidium provides a means categorizing knowledge to improve its delivery.

## Overview & Key Concepts

Almost any knowledge base requires an overview, and a discussion of key concepts that **prime** the reader for a cogent use of the rest of the content. These two sections naturally are presented first, and follow each other.

## Prerequisites & Getting Started

For software projects, APIs and similar documentation, most readers will require some preparation before being able to use your product. This may include installing libraries, binaries, or reading material that they should know before proceeding.

The Prerequisites section supports Getting Started. Getting Started is intended to be a quick deep-dive, such that the user is able to get from *nowhere* to *running* in a matter of minutes.

## Best Practices

Outline, and present the path to follow to get the most out of your product.
