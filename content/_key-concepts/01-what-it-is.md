It's a static website generator with fancy Javascript for navigation and bells a whistles. but its good enough for most uses. We keep it static to make it easy to publish using github as a platform. you don't need to ask permission or get a server setup. you can do it now, today.

Its more than a framework. Its a framework built around a process. Yes it's opinionated, but its good enough, and who wants to spend time documenting code? Software documentation that doesn't suck is not just a tagline.
