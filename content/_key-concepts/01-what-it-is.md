title: Inside Presidium
---

Presidium at its core is simply a static website generator built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that includes [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components for features like navigation and search. By using this model Presidium optimizes for the common case where users ultimately want to start publishing their content quickly and painlessly. Being static allows Presidium to make the job of publishing easier - you don't need to provision a server, you can host your documentation in a matter of seconds on Github Pages. 

However, its more than a framework. Its a framework built around a process. And, yes it's opinionated, but informed - who wants to spend time documenting code? Software documentation that doesn't suck is not just a tagline.
