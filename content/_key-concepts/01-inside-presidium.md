title:  Inside Presidium
---
At its core, Presidium is a static website generator built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that includes [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components for features such as navigation and search. This model enables users to publish their content quickly and painlessly. Being static simplifies publication - you don't need to provision a server and can host your documentation in a matter of seconds on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Presidium is more than a framework. It's a framework built around a process. And, yes it's opinionated, but it's informed too - who wants to spend time documenting code? *Software documentation that doesn't suck* is not just a tagline.
