title:  Inside Presidium
---
At its core, Presidium is a static website generator built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that includes [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components for features like navigation and search. This model enables users to publish their content quickly and painlessly. By using this model, Being static enables Presidium to simplify publication - you don't need to provision a server and can host your documentation in a matter of seconds on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Presidium more than a framework. It's a framework built around a process. And, yes it's opinionated, but informed - who wants to spend time documenting code? Software documentation that doesn't suck is not just a tagline.
