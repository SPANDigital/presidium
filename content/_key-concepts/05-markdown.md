title: Efficient Authoring With Markdown
---

Markdown is an ubiquitous lighweight markup language known to almost any engineer - and, if you don't know it, its quick to pickup. Presidium uses a version of Markdown known as [Github Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) and leverages this 'common toungue' to make it easier for many contributors to create documentation quickly without wasting time doing **point & click** styling or having to alter HTML and CSS.

## Style Guides

For any documentation project, a markdown style guide is a simple way to ensure contributors add documentation in a manner consistent with your intended tone and layout.

## Flexibility

If you need more flexibility than what is offered by Markdown, you can also use HTML separately or mixed alongside the markdown content in articles.
