System models are curated by engineers and product managers based on data ingested from various development and operational systems. These data are grouped together into independent models that can be queried in a variety of ways and visualized using various interactive graphical representations. ADSS models are based on a simple classification of system components. Despite this simplicity, accurate, hi-fidelity models can be created because of the flexible ways in which components can be joined together to create the model.

The core of each ADSS model is composed of [Objects]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#object) their inter-[Relationships]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#relationship-type) and the deployed [Instances]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#instance).
