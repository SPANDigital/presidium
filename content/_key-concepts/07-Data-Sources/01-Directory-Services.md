From on premise directory services systems like LDAP, or similar cloud based services, ADSS gathers information on the enterprise: the groups and divisions that comprise the [Organization]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#organization) as well as the [People]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#people) - developers and managers and their reporting structure. This information is used to track ownership and collaboration within each model.
