| FunctionalArea=Recommendations | Selects the functional area called “Recommendations”,  all the objects it contains and all their relationships. |
| Category=System | Selects all “System” objects and all their relationships | 
| Person=JonDoe | Select all objects owned by “Jon Doe” and all their relationships |
