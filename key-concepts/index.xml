It asks you to think about, structure, author, and
publish content based on sensible best practices so you can write effective documentation, rather than producing
documentation for documentation’s sake.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="supporting-learning-objectives--efficiency">Supporting Learning Objectives &amp;amp; Efficiency&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Presidium recommends creating small micro-articles that convey enough information to fulfill a learning objective.
Small articles are advantageous because they:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Usually only require a single author&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Force the author to focus on effectively describing a single concept&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enable authors to quickly add documentation while also working on a product or service.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using this method, creating high quality content is part of the engineering process, not a deferred or protracted task.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Menu Structure</title><link>/key-concepts/menu-structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/key-concepts/menu-structure/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="structure">Structure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For simplicity and transparency, the menu structure and associated directory structure are the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="behavior">Behavior&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A significant feature of the menu is its tree structure: &lt;strong>each section or subsection is a node&lt;/strong> and content traverses from
each node through its children. In Presidium, the node &lt;code>name&lt;/code> or title becomes the main header of the page.
Everything outside of that sub-tree is not presented on the page. In this example, the user has clicked Content
Structure. Everything under that section is displayed:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Templates</title><link>/key-concepts/templates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/key-concepts/templates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Presidium includes article templates for each of the pre-defined sections. Templates are text documents that contain
instructions and Markdown which can be modified to meet your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Templates encourage consistency and provide a simple checklist that an author can use for inspiration.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;h3 id="identify-the-author">Identify the Author&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Whether you’re creating a single article or an entire section, make sure to include the author tag in the front matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="work-locally">Work Locally&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Presidium encourages you to write and review documentation on your local machine, rather than making changes directly
on Github. The advantages to this workflow are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Changes are immediately viewable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can leverage Presidium’s validation tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Git commit history will have less noise&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="protect-master">Protect Master&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you own the documentation project, make sure you prevent others from making commits or pushing to the Master branch.
You will be publishing from the Master branch, so you want to maintain its integrity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning Objectives</title><link>/key-concepts/learning-objectives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/key-concepts/learning-objectives/</guid><description>&lt;p>You should define the knowledge and skill set of your target audience before starting your documentation.
You can then use this information to avoid wasting time explaining information your audience already knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as stories are used to define software, learning objectives can be written using a standard template:
&lt;em>As a [user] of the [solution] I [know a specific piece of information] or can [perform a specific task]&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For each learning objective, you should:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Markdown</title><link>/key-concepts/markdown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/key-concepts/markdown/</guid><description>&lt;p>Markdown is an ubiquitous, lighweight markup language known to almost any engineer. If you don’t know Markdown,
it’s easy to learn. Presidium uses a version of Markdown known as
&lt;a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Flavoured Markdown&lt;/a> and
leverages this ‘common tongue’ to enable multiple contributors to create documentation quickly without wasting time doing
&lt;strong>point &amp;amp; click&lt;/strong> styling or having to alter HTML and CSS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="style-guides">Style Guides&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For any documentation project, a Markdown style guide ensures that contributors write documentation that is consistent
with your intended tone and layout.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Micro-articles</title><link>/key-concepts/micro-articles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/key-concepts/micro-articles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Presidium is built on sound theoretical strategies for developing learning content and managing knowledge assets.
The core of this approach is the development of specific focused micro-articles that explain individual concepts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This splits the problem of content development into two parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Defining a site outline based on the concepts that must be documented and how they should be sequenced and presented.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Developing articles that each explain each concept, using a standard template to ensure consistency.
Micro-articles break the documentation development and maintenance activities into manageable chunks that can be
prioritized based on need. In many cases, it’s possible to write and review an article in under 20 minutes.

Instead of a monolithic document,
Presidium manages a directory structure of micro-articles. The directory structure maps to the sections of your site,
while the articles are joined together to build the content of each section. You can create a directory to add new
sections and sub-sections. Each section contains a sample article template you can use as a starting point when creating
new content. This site explains other best practices for writing articles.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
