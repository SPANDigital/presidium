Markdown allows bullets and numbering to be nested.

Use bullets to list unordered items.

# Bullets

* Sentence 1.
* Sentence 2.
    - Nested sentence 1.
    - Nested sentence 2.
        + Double nested sentence.

```md
* Sentence 1.
* Sentence 2.
    - Nested sentence 1.
    - Nested sentence 2.
        + Double nested sentence.
```

# Numbering

Use a numbered list for steps that should be done in order. You can number the list yourself or have Presidium do the numbering automatically:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three

4. Four
5. Five
6. Six

```md
1. One
1. Two
1. Three

4. Four
5. Five
6. Six
```
