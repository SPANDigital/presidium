The `_index.md` file is required in every directory (folder). Its [frontmatter]({{< ref "presidium-basics/#front-matter" >}}) specifies the sectionâ€™s title and, optionally, other metadata.

It can also include introductory content, preferably short.

In some cases, if it makes sense to have a short article that appears as a top-level section, the `_index.md` file can make up the entire section.
