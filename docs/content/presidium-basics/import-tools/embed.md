A fallback approach to importing generated documentation is to embed documentation in an iframe, using the `iframe` shortcode supplied with Presidium.

When possible, use a simple template when embedding documentation in an iframe.

To include documentation in an iframe:
1. Generate the static site documentation for your component.
2. Put the documentation in the `/static` folder so that itâ€™s statically served. The Presidium convention is to place it under `/static/import/{my-reference}`.
3. Add a reference article to the Reference section:

```
    ---
    title: My Reference
    ---
    # foo.bar

    {{</* iframe src="/static/import/{my-reference}" */>}}
```

You can create multiple Markdown files for different components as required.
