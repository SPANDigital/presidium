The process of importing documentation involves parsing a reference source and generating articles that are included in the generated site. This can be useful if you want to add a client library, API specification, or similar reference content to a docset. If the reference content will continue to be maintained outside of Presidium, periodic imports can keep the two synchronized.

Presidium supports the following documentation sources:
* OpenAPI3
* HTML
* RST
* JSON
* Embedding
