Archetypes define article types by specifying the expected frontmatter fields.

Currently Presdium provides two article archetypes:

This archetype is the standard used for most articles. It defines front matter requirements such as title, and optional fields like author and date. It is also used in the Design and Onboarding docset template


#### Blog Archetype
 Tailored for blog postings, this archetype includes a structured front matter configuration that supports metadata such as title, author, and publish date.
