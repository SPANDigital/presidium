There are various ways of publishing Presidium modules. Here is a recommended may of integrating publication with a  CI (Continuous Integration) build pipeline. This setup ensures that documentation is updated in real-time as your solution evolves.
1. Set up a CI Pipeline

    Integrate the module publishing process into an existing or new CI pipeline. This enables automatic updates whenever changes are committed to the repository, supporting continuous publication and seamless re-indexing of new content.

1. Publish

   Once changes are committed and successfully pass through the CI pipeline, the updated module is published. This ensures that the latest documentation is immediately available.
