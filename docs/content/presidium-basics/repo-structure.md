**Folders**
* content: Holds the Markdown files that are the content of the docsite, and the  subfolders that contribute to determining the docsite structure.
* static: Contains assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files that are integral to the site but don't change frequently.

**File:** config.yaml: Defines the docset's navigational structure, along with global site settings like the docset title, base URL, layouts, and styling.
