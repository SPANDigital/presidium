Presidium is an open-source set of writing tools and themes that extends the functionality of the Hugo static site generator. It is specifically tailored for creating and maintaining software documentation for Agile teams and their users. Its static nature simplifies publication, enabling you to host your documentation swiftly and cost-effectively on platforms like GitHub Pages, easily integrating into your continuous integration pipeline.

Presidium empowers Agile teams to effectively evangelize, explain, and support solutions for their peers, promoting correct usage and successful adoption. Unlike unstructured wikis or the ephemeral knowledge of Slack channels, Presidium offers a structured approach that leverages the precision of predefined article templates and an intuitive menu structure.

Presidium extends Hugo with additional features, making it more than just a static site generator. For example:

- Module templates: Preconfigured layout and framework for use cases such as blogs and onboarding, as well as a general document template
- Automatic generation of the left navigation menu
- Permalink icon: single click to copy a link to an article
- Article maturity status indicators
- Front matter validation checks

Presidium is designed to lend itself to the use of sound theoretical strategies for developing learning content and managing knowledge assets, with the core principle being the development of specific, focused micro-articles. These are concise, self-contained articles that explain individual concepts clearly and effectively, improving the accessibility and usability of documentation. This practice not only facilitates easier knowledge transfer and quicker information retrieval but also streamlines the update process, ensuring documentation remains accurate and relevant.

Also available is [Presidium Enterprise](https://test.presidium.spandigital.io/docs/presidium), which supports advanced features such as:

- Landing page: Users can see their reading history, see a list of available modules, search across them, get notifications, and so on.
- Article bar: Each article shows freshness, comments, up/down votes, and reported issues
- Advanced configuration: Ability to specify module features across the enterprise and override them per module.
- User authentication and access controls.
- Collections and collection manager
- User engagement analytics for content authors
- Reading histories

Presidium is developed by SPAN Digital and is licensed under Apache 2.0, guaranteeing robust community support and a proven foundation.
