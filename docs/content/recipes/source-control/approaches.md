Presidium content can be managed in various ways depending on your project needs. Content may be hosted in:
* A dedicated repo that only contains documentation
* A sub-folder of an existing repo
* A git sub-module of an existing repo

A dedicated repo is simpler to configure and easier to manage independently. Managing content within in a sub directory inside the a source code repo keeps everything in one place and makes it easier to update the documents while changing the code. A sub-module may be the best of both worlds, but is slightly more complex to manage.
