Presidium content can be managed in various ways depending on your project needs. Content may be hosted in:

- A dedicated repo that only contains documentation
- A sub-folder of an existing repo

A dedicated repo is simpler to configure and easier to manage independently. Managing content within in a sub directory 
inside the source code repo keeps everything in one place and makes it easier to update the documents while changing the
code.
