A common use case is to build Presidium documentation using a continuous integration environment. The generated website can be served by a web host of your choice depending on your particular requirements.

Running `hugo` will build the generated static website in the `public` directory. This may be copied over and served by any host such as Apache HTTP, Nginx or an AWS S3.
