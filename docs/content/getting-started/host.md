Presidium builds a static website in the `dist/site` directory which may be hosted by [any web server]({{% baseurl %}}/recipes/hosting/#custom-hosting).

If you are using Github or Bitbucket to manage your documentation, you may choose to use [Github Pages]({{% baseurl %}}/recipes/hosting/#github-pages) or [Bitbucket]({{% baseurl %}}/recipes/hosting/#bitbucket) to quickly and easily publish your documentation online.
