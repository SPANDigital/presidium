Start the Presidium Writing Tool wizard to create a new Presidium Site from one of our curated `content starter templates`:

```
presidium init
```

Follow the wizard instructions:

- **Project Name**: The name of the folder that contains your Presidium Site
- **Title**: The title for your Presidium Site
- **Template**: The template to use. Templates provide different starting sites based on your needs.
- ~~**Theme**: The theme to use. Themes provide different look and feel for your Presidium Site~~ `deprecated`

Then, navigate to the newly created folder (with your project name) and start a local server:

You have two main ways to run your new Presidium site using Hugo:
```
make serve
```
OR
```
hugo serve
```
