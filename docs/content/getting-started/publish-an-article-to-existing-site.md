#### Prerequisites
Before contributing to a Presidium project, ensure you have access to the existing Presidium project repository.
Familiarity with Markdown, a lightweight markup language, and Git for version control is essential. You should have
both installed on your local machine.

#### Install Presidium

Begin by [installing presidium]({{< ref "getting-started#install-presidium" >}}).

#### Clone Documentation Repository

Clone the required documentation repository and open it in your text editor of choice.

#### Add Your Content

[Add content]({{< ref "getting-started#add-content" >}}) to the site.

#### Run Presidium Locally

After making content changes, use Hugo to preview your site:
```bash
hugo serve
```

This opens the site on `http://localhost:1313`, providing a browser view of what end users will experience.
