Layouts and styling determine the visual structure and aesthetic of modules. 
* Layouts define structural features of the module such as available shortcodes and the organization of content on the page (headers and footers, the placement of elements like images and sidebars, and so on). 
*  Styling defines aspects of appearance such as font choice, text size, and color schemes.
