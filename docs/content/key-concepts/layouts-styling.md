Layouts and styling determine the visual structure and aesthetic of modules. 
* Layouts generate the HTML (or other output formats, such as JSON). They thus define structural features of the module such as available shortcodes and the organization of content on the page (headers and footers, the placement of elements like images and sidebars, and so on). 
*  Styling involves the CSS, images, and other items that define aspects of appearance such as font choice, text size, and color schemes.
