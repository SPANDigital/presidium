Layouts and styling determine the visual structure and aesthetic of docsets. 
* Layouts define the organization of content on the page, such as the width of text areas and placement of elements like images and sidebars. 
*  Styling defines aspects of appearance such as font choice, text size, and color schemes.

Presidium stores default layouts and styling separately, allowing for customization at different levels.
