Presidium is built on sound theoretical strategies for developing learning content and managing knowledge assets. The core of this approach is the development of specific focused micro-articles that explain individual concepts.

This splits the problem of content development into two parts:

1.	Defining a site outline based on the concepts that must be documented and how they should be sequenced and presented.
2.	Developing articles that each explain each concept, using a standard template to ensure consistency.

Micro-articles break the documentation development and maintenance activities into manageable chunks that can be prioritized based on need. In many cases, it's possible to write and review an article in under 20 minutes. [Writing Effecive Articles]({{% baseurl %}}/best-practices/#writing-effective-articles)

This Presidium documentation site not only explains the Presidium software but also includes best practice guidelines for writing your documentation.
