Presidium can ingest marked up source code and API specs, allowing you to reuse existing documentation investments. Imported documentation will be included in the menu and sitemap.

Presidium supports the following documentation sources:
- [javadoc comments](#javadoc)
- [jsdoc comments](#jsdoc)
- [swagger api](#swagger)

For other sources that do not yet have an importer, documentation can be [embedded](#embed) into references.
