Presidium is designed to make it easy to write and maintain your documentation. Instead of a monolithic document, 
Presidium manages a directory structure of micro-articles. The directory structure maps to the sections of your site, 
while the articles are joined together to build the content of each section. You can create a directory to add new 
sections and sub-sections. Each section contains a sample article template you can use as a starting point when creating
new content. This site explains other best practices for writing articles.

If you know how to maintain a codebase in a Github repository, you already know how to maintain Presidium documentation.
You can use your team’s current Github workflow to manage the approval and publication process and use Github’s features
to handle merge conflicts and other issues, just as you do for your source code. You can easily modify the suggested 
site structure and behavior. Most teams only need to remove a few sections that are not relevant to their project. 
Presidium has several configurable features that can be enabled as needed.
