Presidium's content model is designed to enhance the effectiveness of documentation by focusing on structured learning objectives. 

The model also promotes the use of micro-articles: brief, focused pieces of content that address specific learning goals. Compartmentalizing information in this way makes it easier to navigate, update, utilize, and understand. Each micro-article is intended to be manageable, typically authored by a single individual, and easily integrated into the standard engineering workflow. This approach ensures that documentation does not become a delayed task but is part of the ongoing development process

We recommend organizing information into categories that logically lead readers from general overviews to specific topics, such as prerequisites, best practices, reference material, and so on. The hierarchical system of categories should align with defined learning objectives, ensuring that each piece of content supports the user's ability to grasp and utilize key concepts effectively.
