In Presidium, a module is a body of knowledge represented by a comprehensive collection of structured articles. By default, the module is presented as a static website, but each article is available to be used in a variety of situations, including search results and recommendations, and embedding in various common systems. The module's articles are produced using standardized templates, to help maintain consistency and coherence.
