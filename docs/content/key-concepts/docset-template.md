Presidium's module templates provide a preconfigured layout and framework for various use cases. Each template includes:
* A set of top-level sections: Overview, Key Concepts, Getting Started, and so on 
* Appropriate layouts and styling

Module templates:
* Aid in maintaining a consistent look and feel across multiple projects
* Help speed up deployment of documentation without starting from scratch every time
