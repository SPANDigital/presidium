Presidium's module templates provide a preconfigured structure and framework for several common scenarios. Each template includes:
* A set of top-level sections: Overview, Key Concepts, Getting Started, and so on. Many of these contain demo articles with suggested content. 
* Appropriate layouts and styling
* A collection of useful short codes
* A collection of useful importers
* Article archetypes for use with the [hugo new content](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_new_content/) command.

Module templates:
* Aid in maintaining a consistent look and feel across multiple projects
* Help speed up deployment of documentation without starting from scratch every time
