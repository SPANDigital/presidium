Presidium can ingest marked up source code and API specs, allowing you to reuse existing documentation investments. 
Imported documentation will be included in the menu and sitemap.

Presidium supports the following documentation sources:

[TODO] // Insert relative links to each importer plugin

- javadoc comments
- jsdoc comments
- swagger api


[TODO] // Insert relative link on how to embed documentation into references
For other sources that do not yet have an importer, documentation can be embedded into references.

[TODO] // Insert relative link to importers article
