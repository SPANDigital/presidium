Frontmatter is a required component of Presidium Markdown articles. It must appear at the beginning of the article, enclosed by three hyphens at the top and bottom. Between the two rows of hyphens is a list of attributes, of which `title` is the only required one. More information is provided in Structuring Content. <span style="color:purple">(link)</span>
