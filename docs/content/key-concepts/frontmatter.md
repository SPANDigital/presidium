Frontmatter is a required component of Presidium Markdown articles. It must appear at the beginning of the article, enclosed by three hyphens at the top and bottom. Between the two rows of hyphens is a list of attributes, such as `title`, specifying the article's title. For more information see [Structuring Content]({{< ref "presidium-basics/structuring-content/front-matter">}}).
