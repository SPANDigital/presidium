Presidium includes article templates for each of the pre-defined sections. Templates are text documents that contain instructions and Markdown which can be modified to meet your needs.

For example, here is the template for the Best Practices section:

    ```# Template Instructions
    # ---------------------   
    # 1) Replace any content placeholders with the appropriate content. Search for "REPLACE WITH".
    # 2) Delete this line and all lines above so that the front matter below is at the top of the file.

    REPLACE WITH a summary paragraph of the recommended practice.

    ```python
        REPLACE WITH A code snippet, if required, that illustrates the recommended practice. Change the name of the language if needed. DELETE the entire section if not required.
    ```

    # Discussion
