Before you write any content, spend some time anticipating what tasks you need to perform and make sure you have the 
time and resources to achieve your goals.

The following steps work for both small and large projects:

1. Design the site structure
1. Inventory existing content
1. Plan the conversion of existing content into articles
1. Map the planned articles to your structure
1. Identify required new articles
1. Repurpose existing content into articles
1. Write new articles
1. Proofread and edit
1. Publish

The most important planning tasks are:
* Identifying the scope of your documentation efforts
* Understanding the needs of your audience.

Presidium [module templates]({{< ref "key-concepts/#module-tempalte" >}}) provide  a set of standard sections that are commonly used in various documentation types. 
You can use this framework when starting to scope your project.
