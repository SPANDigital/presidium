Anyone can write great articles if they follow a few simple style guidelines:

* Make sure the title explains what the article is about. The title will be used to construct the navigation menu and will often be separated from the article body alongside other article titles.
* Make sure the title works on its own and describes the essence of the article.
* Keep titles simple and succinct without using humor or colloquialisms.  
* Have one author for every article. This enables authors to quickly add documentation while also working on a product or service.

Articles should convey enough information to fulfill a learning objective.
