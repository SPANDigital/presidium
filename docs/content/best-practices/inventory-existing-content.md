title: Inventory Existing Content
weight: 4
---

When starting a new documentation project, you should first review and evaluate existing content. Content from multiple 
sources, such as those listed below, can be repurposed:

- Existing software documentation
- Wikis and message boards
- Design documents
- Work tickets (epics and stories, bugs)
- API specifications
- README files
- Code comments and markup
- Help files
- Emails
- Meeting notes
- Project planning materials

Before starting:

1. Compile a list of existing content sources.
1. Identify how each item could be decomposed or converted into an article.
1. Identify where these articles can fit in your documentation structure.

If there is no existing documentation set, some areas will be well documented, while others will either be poorly 
defined or missing. Expect to find duplicate and outdated content. Maintain a list of the best documentation you find 
for any learning objective.
