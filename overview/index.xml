documentation for Agile teams and their users. Being static simplifies publication - you don’t need to provision
a server and can host your documentation in a matter of seconds on Github Pages.
You can easily include documentation publication in your continuous integration pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Presidium gives Agile teams a way to evangelize, explain, and support solutions to their peers so they can be
correctly used and successfully adopted. Wikis can be unstructured and lose their value, tribal knowledge and
content stored on Slack channels or emails can go into a black hole. Engineers are experts at writing code, not
documentation. &lt;em>Software documentation that doesn’t suck&lt;/em> is not just a tagline.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
