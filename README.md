# Presidium

[Presidium](http://presidium.spandigital.net) is a software documentation management system for agile teams and their users made from the stuff software engineers love. Presidium uses familiar tools already in use by many software development teams to easily compose and publish and manage quality documentation.

Read Presidium's [documentation](http://presidium.spandigital.net/overview/) for details on all features and for help on setting up a new project using the [sample template](https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-template).

# Features and Issues
All upcoming features and issues are tracked [here](https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium/issues)

# Development

Presidium is built on two core projects:

1. [presidium-core](https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-core): An npm package that bundles all workflows, layouts and dependencies required to build and publish documentation
1. [presidium-js](https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-js): User interface javascript components built using reactjs

This repository tracks Presidium's [user documentation](http://presidium.spandigital.net/overview/) and provides a sample of how presidium is used.
