# Presidium

This repository tracks Presidium's [user documentation](http://presidium.spandigital.net/overview/) and provides a sample of how presidium is used.

# What is Presidium? 

[Presidium](http://presidium.spandigital.net) is a software documentation management system for agile teams and their users made from the stuff software engineers love. Presidium uses familiar tools already in use by many software development teams to easily compose and publish and manage quality documentation.

Read Presidium's [documentation](http://presidium.spandigital.net/overview/) for details on all features and for help on setting up a new project using the [sample template](https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-template).

# Development

Presidium is built on two core projects:

* [presidium-core](https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-core): A Node.js package that bundles all of the workflows, layouts and dependencies required to build and publish documentation

* [presidium-js](https://github.com/SPANDigital/presidium-js): Presidium's user interface built using [React](http://reactjs.org). Note: `presidium-js` is already bundled with `presidium-core`.
