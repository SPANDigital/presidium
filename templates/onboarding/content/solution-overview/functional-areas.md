This article should contain information on the functional areas in the application. A functional area is a set of services that work together to achieve a particular business objective/outcome.

Billing is one example of a functional area. Within that functional area, there could be a set of services (databases, APIs, message queues) that together facilitate and support the gathering of revenue, stats collection, the timely billing of customers, etc.

Additionally, this article can list other functional areas in your enterprise that a new hire will likely interface with and therefore need to be aware of (for example, Advertising, Analytics etc.).
