This article should describe the standard development workflow. For example, the following workflow might be used for a hotfix:

1. Create branch off of master.
2. Develop-test cycle.
3. Make changes.
4. Test changes.
5. Submit a pull request from the feature branch to master.
6. After it's approved, merge PR and release a new version from master.
7. Delete the source branch after merge.
8. Update dependencies to point to released version.
9. Release hotfix.
