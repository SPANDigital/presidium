This article should describe the design system vision. A popular view is that design principles should promote *clarity*, *efficiency*, *consistency*, and *beauty* in the design system. Design principles can be described in the context of:

* Design motivations
* Design considerations
* Company core values

In addition to visual elements, design principles should also apply to the writing style and tone of the application, including guidance around colloquial language and branding messaging standards.
