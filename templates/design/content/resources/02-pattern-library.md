In addition to a Style Guide, a design system should have Pattern Library. A Pattern Library is a collection of design elements that appear multiple times on a site. Having a Pattern Library helps maintain a consistent UI, helps with reusability, and makes it easier to maintain the design system. Typically, it contains UI components and the code that implements them, templates, and reference files.

Like design systems and style guides, pattern libraries should be versioned and maintained as they evolve over time.
