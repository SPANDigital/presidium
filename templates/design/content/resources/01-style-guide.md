This article should contain a link to the style guide. It's important to understand that a style guide is not the same as a design system. According to design system expert Nathan Curtis, "A style guide is an artifact of design process." Brad Frost puts it this way: "A style guide serves as the storefront that showcases all of the design systemâ€™s ingredients, and serves as a tangible center of mass for the whole endeavor."

There might be different style guides for various output, for example:
* Web
* TV
* iOS
* Android

Like design systems, style guides should be versioned and maintained as they evolve over time.
