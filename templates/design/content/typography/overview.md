This article should contain information about the selected typography and explain how this typography informs the design principles. It should include examples of the typography on its own and, optionally, in context. It should also include a link for [downloading the font family]({{ `{{< ref "resources/fonts.md" >}}` }}).

Some design systems will specify a single font while others might allow different fonts based on the application.

This section can include the following articles, with examples:
* **Type scale**: Small, medium, large
* **Additional emphasis**: Strong, light
* **Display styles**: Titles, headings, subheadings, captions, etc.
* **Emphasis styles**: Content hierarchy
* **Font stack**: CSS code sample

Other possible articles include:
* Terms & conditions for using a custom font (for example, not using that font externally for personal projects)
* Guidelines for the different application of fonts in applications and marketing or sales materials
