If applicable, this article should describe the accessibility features of the design system, as required by Section 508. Accessibility includes considerations about appropriate use of color, keyboard navigation, and text-based alternatives to images and icons.

Section 508 is an amendment to The Rehabilitation Act that protects the right of people with disabilities to have equal access to electronic and information technology. All federal government departments or organizations that receive federal funding contracts must follow the guidelines in Section 508. This includes all federal government departments, every organization that receives federal contracts or funding, and educational institutions that receive federal funding via the Assistive Technology Act.
