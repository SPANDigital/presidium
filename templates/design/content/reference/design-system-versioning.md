This article should contain information about the versioning convention that will be used for the design system as it evolves. It is just as important to track the evolution of the design system as it is to capture the initial vision, designs, assumptions, and conventions.

The industry best practice is to use the major, minor, patch [standard semantic versioning model](https://semver.org/) that is standard for software applications.

Versioning should also include conventions around deprecating parts of the design system.
