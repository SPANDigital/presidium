This article should set the stage and tone for the rest of the design system, following this definition by  design expert Nathan Curtis: **"A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap and backlog, serving an ecosystem."**

The Overview article should address who will use the design system and why. Optionally, it can also define who's responsible for maintaining the design system.

It can also include links to other key articles, such as:

* [Design principles]({{ `{{< ref "design-principles/01-design-principles.md" >}}` }})
* [Branding]({{ `{{< ref "design-principles/branding.md" >}}` }})
* [Style Guide]({{ ref "resources/01-style-guide.md" }})
* [Pattern Library]({{ ref "resources/02-pattern-library.md" }})
