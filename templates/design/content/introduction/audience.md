 This article should contain information about the intended users of the design system -- typically, designers and developers.

 Optionally, it can provide separate roadmaps for each kind of user, directing them to the parts of the design system that will be most relevant to them. For example, designers can be pointed to articles on guidelines and components, while developers can be pointed to articles on markup and style guidelines,  class naming conventions, and contribution guidelines.
